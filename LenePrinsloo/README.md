**Movie Rental** 

_`This project is about a Movie Rental Store. Logging into the System and creating employees and customers. Keeping count of the customers, rented movies and movie copies. 
  `_
  
  `I conducted research at the Movie Rental Store where I stay and they do their bookings by writing it down in a book. They don’t have a database system or anything computerised at the moment. It is a small town so a lot of people are interested in renting movies and it’s an issue because having to keep track of the records is slow and inefficient. 
  I propose to create a simplified booking and return movie rental system.
